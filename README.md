• Dask is a flexible library for parallel 
computing in Python. Dask is composed of 
two parts: Dynamic task scheduling 
optimized for computation. This is similar to 
Airflow, Luigi, Celery, or Make, but 
optimized for interactive computational 
workloads
• Dask is a free and open-source library for 
parallel computing in Python. Dask helps 
you scale your data science and machine 
learning workflows. Dask makes it easy to 
work with Numpy, pandas, and Scikit-Learn, 
but that's just the beginning.
• Apache Cassandra is an open source, useravailable, distributed, NoSQL DBMS which is 
designed to handle large amounts of data 
across many servers. It provides zero point 
of failure. Cassandra offers massive support 
for clusters spanning multiple datacentre
